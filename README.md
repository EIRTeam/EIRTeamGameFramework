# EIRTeam Common Game Framework

This is a compilation of scripts and code that I have used over time in various games, includes the following features:

- Automatic class serialization
- Automatic handling of controller changes
- Automatic input prompts
- User settings system
- Menu system (including controller support)
- General use utilities file

More things will be added in the future
